In no event shall We be liable or responsible for any damages, claims, applications, losses, injuries, delays, accidents, costs, business interruption costs, or other expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys&rsquo; fees or the costs of any claim or suit), nor for any incidental, direct, general, indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages, loss of goodwill or business profits, loss of cryptocurrency or digital assets, work stoppage, computer or device failure or malfunction, or any other commercial or other losses directly or indirectly arising out of or related to:</span></p><ol class="c8 lst-kix_rje0hwi8kgbc-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c1">our Terms;</span></li><li class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c1">the Privacy and Transparency Statement;</span></li><li class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c1">any service We provide;</span></li><li class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c1">the use of the App;</span></li><li class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c1">any use of your digital assets or cryptocurrency with the App by any other party not authorized by you (collectively, all of the foregoing items shall be referred to herein as &ldquo;Losses&rdquo;).</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">We are hereby released by You from liability for any kind of the above-mentioned Losses. We disclaim any and all warranties or guarantees, including any warranty of merchantability and warranty of fitness for any particular purpose. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">The foregoing limitations of liability shall apply whether the alleged liability or Losses are based on contract, negligence, tort, strict liability, or any other basis, even if We have been advised of or should have known of the possibility of such losses and damages, and without regard to the success or effectiveness of other remedies. Notwithstanding anything else in our Terms, in no event shall the combined aggregate liability for any Loss hereunder exceed &euro; 50.00 (fifty euros). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">3. Prices, Exchange Rates, Surety and Confirmations</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c1 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">3.1</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;Users are hereby informed that Cryptocurrencies and digital assets in general are highly experimental and risky. Our App attempts to provide accurate price and exchange rate information, but this information is as well highly volatile and can change quickly without Users or Us necessarily being aware of these changes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">3.2</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;The exchange rate that the Customer pays (if applicable) is calculated at the moment the App presents the amount due to the customer (via the QR Code or NFC signal). Our App will always seek out the best price for the Customer.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">3.3</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;The confirmation time of some cryptocurrencies can be very lengthy. For example, if a customer pays with a slow coin such as the Petro (Venezuela) but pays a minimal miner fee when sending their funds to the App, then that customer&rsquo;s payment may not be processed by that network for many hours, if at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Due to this risk, the App offers a Surety feature, allowing You to voluntarily pre-fund a Multisig blockchain account (for example: joes-grocery-morphit) with some Bitshares (BTS) tokens, and then voluntarily share that account with the Morphit bridge algorithm in the App temporarily. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">This way, the bridge can send the necessary BTS or smartcoins to the Merchant instantly, be protected from customer minimal miner fee or double-spend scams, and confirm the customers &quot;completed&quot; payment so that the customer doesn&#39;t have to stand there waiting for their (slow coin) payment to confirm. The customer can then theoretically pay with any supported coin and leave in as little as 3 seconds. Payments in a Bitshares token do not require use of a bridge or surety at all since that chain is so fast. Steem payments don&#39;t need surety either, but the bridge is used real quick to convert it to the merchants desired BTS or smartcoin. The merchant can empty their surety account any time they like, or add more funds to it for high volume (such as grocery chains) or larger transactions (such as homes or cars). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">If however, the customer&rsquo;s payment is never confirmed by their network, then that amount of Surety that was shared with the bridge will not be released back to You. The bridge will not assume any risk of Your customers payments not clearing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Due to individual blockchain specifications, the Customer payment is typically considered &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; by the bridge at two block confirmations. If a bridge had to be used, the bridge will then automatically release the Surety back to you that was shared while the bridge was awaiting those two block confirmations. It is important to note that a payment being broadcast to a blockchain network does not constitute an acceptance by the App of that payment. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c1 c2">4. Returns and Refund Policy</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c1 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">4.1 </span><span class="c4 c1">Cryptocurrencies, tokens, and digital assets are, by their nature, generally irreversible, and their exchange rates are highly volatile and transitory. Once the User&rsquo;s asset has been transmitted to the User&rsquo;s address, no refund is possible, even if the wrong address was provided to the App. All sales after transmission are final and the Company is not in position to reverse or correct the process already undertaken by the App.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c1 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">4.2</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;Surety can be 100% refunded at any time from within the App itself. With no pre-funded bridge Surety however, only EOS or Graphene-based cryptocurrencies should be accepted (such as Steem and/or Bitshares tokens). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c1 c2">5. Governing Law</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c1 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">5.1</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;These Terms are governed by the laws of Cyprus, and any and all laws applicable therein. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">5.2</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;Our Terms are to be treated in all respects as a Cypriot contract.

Permissible Use</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">The App and all its services may be used only as a mechanism of software ledger entry translation between the User and the Bitshares blockchain. You are prohibited from using the App for the purpose of translating ledger entries with other parties, with the exception of explicit payment for goods and services. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">7.

By using the App, you agree to be bound by the then-current version of our Terms. All modifications generally apply ex nunc, unless otherwise specified in special cases, if this is justified by the circumstances. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">7.2</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;The Terms as they appear on the website of our App are always up-to-date.

These costs will be calculated by the Company taking into account the relevant administrative burden caused to it and will be communicated to the Customer. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">8.3</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;No response will be sent to the Customer if this entails a payment from his side, before the cost is communicated to him by the email provided by him for this specific purpose. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">9.
